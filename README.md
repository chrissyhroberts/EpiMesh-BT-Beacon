# EpiMesh-BT-Beacon
A Bluetooth Beacon Network for logging proximities of entities across time via Bluetooth - ESP32-C3 based.

## Hardware

* ESP32-C3 Development Board (WiFi/Bluetooth)  
I bought three for Â£16.99 on Amazon  
https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DMN6VKNN?ref_=pe_27063361_487360311_302_E_DDE_dt_1  

* USB-C cable with data & power  

## Setup

Out of the box, the boards need to be wiped and also need firmware adding.

Download the firmware from https://micropython.org/download/ESP32_GENERIC/  
I used v1.24.1 : https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/ESP32_GENERIC-20241129-v1.24.1.bin  

Open terminal and add the esp control tools, which can be used to flash firmware

```
pip3 install esptool
```
Check the installation with

```
 esptool.py
```
This should show you the help file. If it does, the installation is good. 

Next Plug in a device via the USB cable. If you see a dialog asking for permission to mount the device, accept it.
List connected devices with

```
ls /dev/cu.*  
```

This should show you something like

> /dev/cu.usbmodem2101

Next, erase the device with

```
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101 erase_flash
```
It should say something like this

>esptool.py v4.8.1  
Serial port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101  
Connecting....  
Chip is ESP32-C3 (QFN32) (revision v0.4)  
Features: WiFi, BLE, Embedded Flash 4MB (XMC)  
Crystal is 40MHz  
MAC: e4:b3:23:d3:9d:64  
Uploading stub...  
Running stub...  
Stub running...  
Erasing flash (this may take a while)...  
Chip erase completed successfully in 16.2s  
Hard resetting via RTS pin...  

Make a note of the device's MAC address, you'll need this later

Next add the new firmware with 

```
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x0 ESP32_GENERIC_C3-20241129-v1.24.1.bin
```
Note that `/dev/cu.usbmodem2101` should match the address you saw when you listed the connected devices.

It should display something like this 

>esptool.py v4.8.1  
Serial port /dev/cu.usbmodem2101  
Connecting....  
Chip is ESP32-C3 (QFN32) (revision v0.4)

Next open **Thonny** https://thonny.org/
Configure the interpreter for Micropython (ESP32)
You should see the files on the micropython device in the lower 'files' section. 

Replace the `boot.py` script with the one from this repo. 
Save and test by running the script. You should see some useful feedback
